👋 Hi, I’m Mastafa.

👀 I’m passionate about Machine Learning. As a Data Scientist at Microsoft, I am currently focusing on Microsoft Copilot, leveraging my background in NLP and Deep Learning. As a teacher, I have helped my students understand NLP models such as GPT, BERT, RoBERTa, XLM, and how to apply them in practical solutions.

🌱 I’m currently diving deep into various aspects of Deep Learning and Statistics. Yes, I do enjoy statistics!

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cutting-edge projects!
